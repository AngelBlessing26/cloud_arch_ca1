Before starting, make sure the Azure CLI is installed and that you are signed in to your Azure account.

Open PowerShell or a terminal in the project folder and sign in by running:

az login

Once logged in, run the setup script:

./setup.ps1

The script will automatically create the resource group, virtual machine and networking resources. 
The virtual machine uses cloud-init, so Apache or Ngnix and the web page are installed during the first startup.
This may take a few minutes.

After the script finishes, go to the Azure Portal.

In the portal:
- Open the resource group called ca1_rg
- Click on the virtual machine named ca1VM
- Copy the Public IP address shown on the overview page

Open a web browser and paste the public IP address into the address bar.

You should see a web page displaying the following text in bold and underlined:

CA1 CLOUD ARCHITECTURE  
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED BY ANGEL ILEOGBEN CA 1

No manual configuration is required on the virtual machine because everything is set up automatically using the cloud-init file.

When you are finished and want to delete the environment, return to PowerShell and run:

./teardown.ps1

This will remove the resource group and all resources created for this assignment.
